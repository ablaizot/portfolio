### Description
The goal is to provide an attitude heading reference system to an aerobatic plane so that the flight could be replayed. Additionally, the control inputs (joystick and pedals) and dashboard are recorded. After the flight, we used computer vision to extract the relevant values from the cameras. With dial readings and the pilot’s inputs, we can recreate the flight in a commercial simulator so that the pilot can improve their aerobatics. So far, we have completed 3 test flights in the client’s plane, recording IMU, GPS, barometer, and camera readings.
