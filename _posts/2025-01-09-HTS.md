### Description
I assembled a data acquisition system for the flowmeters on a liquid engine test stand at BURPG. The flowmeters were magnetic pickup flowmeters, meaning the frequency of the signal is proportional to the flow rate. I used Python on Raspberry Pi to interface with a Labjack, which is an off the shelf DAQ system. The Raspberry Pi set the Labjack to sample at twice the maximum frequency of the flowmeter. In MATLAB, I used a short time fourier transform to extract the flow rate using a short time fast fourier transform. I also generated spectrograms to analyze the data.
