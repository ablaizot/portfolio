### Description
With one other person, I designed and programmed a liquid rocket flight computer and ground support equipment for the Boston University Rocket Propulsion group. The team was rolling out the new ground support boards, flight computer, and a new control GUI simultaneously, which made diagnosing issues challenging.. The hardware principally consisted of a STM32F4, ADCs, solenoid drivers, and an ethernet module. For the embedded devices, we used C and C++, but the project required some python to analyze data and tweak the GUI. For our programming paradigm, we used OOP, with each sensor having a child class, to help us compartmentalize the work. Through configuration packets sent over the network, we populated a map with the sensor objects, making the boards more resilient in the case of hardware failures as we could swap sensors without reflashing. We were able to make the firmware cross platform with the Teensy 4.1 on our GSE boards, allowing us to streamline development of both systems. My individual contributions to the code are the data logging to SD card, the altimeter, the accelerometer, and the state machine, but there are no parts of the code or design that I have not modified.

Additionally, I particitpated in the numerous cold flows and hot fires to validate the hot fire.
