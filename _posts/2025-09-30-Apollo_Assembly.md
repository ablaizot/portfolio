### Objective
Assemble and test 40 preproduction Apollo data acquisition and trigger boards to be used in the ALTAS and CMS experiments at the LHC.

### Status
In a little over two months, I learned how to assemble the boards and test the FPGAs, before automating as much of the process as possible, and teaching colleagues how to assemble and test the boards themselves. By developing tools to help myself, I completed the preproduction ahead of schedule while also increasing the productivity of those that will handle the production run.

### Repositories
The instuctions I wrote to assemble and test the boards are found in [Apollo Assembly Instructions](https://apollo-lhc.gitlab.io/Assembly/Rev3-assembly/). These are now being used by my colleagues to assemble and test the production run of 300 boards.
