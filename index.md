### [AXI DMA for CERN DAQ Board](https://ablaizot.github.io/portfolio/2025/01/09/DMA_Driver.html)
I implemented an AXI DMA with the goal of improving chip to chip communication between a Zynq SoC and two Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs.
This project involved firmware, kernel drivers, and software. More information on the application can be found in this [TWEPP conference paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03702)


### Aerobatic Black Box, Senior Design Project
- Developed an attitude and heading reference system to capture and replay an aerobatic flight.
- Ensured that fusion of GPS, barometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes accurately tracked plane movement.
- Integrated cameras to record dashboard and control inputs into sensor package.
### Liquid Bipropellant Rocket Test Campaign, BU Rocket Propulsion Group 
-  Deployed new flight and GSE software for 4 cold flows, 2 hot fire attempts, and 2 hot fires.
- Performed electrical and sensor checkouts with new inhouse GUI and firmware stack.
- Resolved 100 ms data loss issues observed after second hot-fire attempt.
### Liquid Bipropellant Rocket Flight Computer, BU Rocket Propulsion Group
- Produced Board I/O schematic and layout in Altium, consolidating connections into D-subs.
- Placed and routed components including ADCs, STM32, voltage monitors, linear regulators, and oscillators.
- Debugged with J-link and logic analyzer leading to second revision.
- Wrote flight software for integrated vehicle tests and launch.
### Horizontal Test Stand Test Campaign, BU Rocket Propulsion Group
- Built and ran data acquisition for magnetic pick-up flowmeter.
- Remotely triggered Raspberry pi to log data from LabJack.
- Used time frequency analysis to extract flow rate using MATLAB.
- Worked on 3 cold flows, 2 hot fires, and 2 hot fire attempts of a liquid bipropellant engine.
