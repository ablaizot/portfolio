### [AXI C2C DMA for CERN DAQ Board](https://ablaizot.github.io/portfolio/2025/01/09/DMA_Driver.html), BU Department of Physics
I implemented an AXI DMA with the goal of improving chip to chip communication between the Zynq SoC and two Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs on the Apollo ATCA
blades for use at the HL-LHC. This project involved firmware, kernel drivers, and software. More information on the Apollo blades can be found in this [TWEPP conference paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03702).

### [Aerobatic Black Box](https://ablaizot.github.io/portfolio/2025/01/09/Aerobatic-black-box.html), Senior Design Project
This Aerobatic Black Box project aims to provide pilots with a means to review their in-flight performance. Our group's device accomplished this task by integrating digital sensors, cameras, and machine vision to record and digitize flight data and cockpit interactions, eventually incorporating this data into a 3D simulation. This simulation will allow pilots to analyze their performance from both internal and external perspectives.

### [Icarus](https://ablaizot.github.io/portfolio/2025/01/09/Icarus.html), BURPG
Icarus is a 17-ft long liquid bipropellant rocket using isopropyl alcohol and nitrous oxide that launched on March 29, 2025, reaching 12902 ft AGL (3932 m). The engine, Iron Lotus IV, has a maximum thrust of 2,500 lbf (11 kN). 
I designed and iterated on a PCB for the flight computer. I also wrote flight software for the sampling and logging of the onboard pressure transducers, thermocouples, accelerometers, and barometric altimeters.

### [Horizontal Test Stand (HTS)](https://ablaizot.github.io/portfolio/2025/01/09/HTS.html), BUPRG
HTS is mobile test stand capable of testing liquid bipropellant engines up to 10,000 lbf. After 3 cold flow operations, HTS fired the Iron Lotus IV engine 3 times in the spring of 2023. I built and ran data acquisition for magnetic pick-up flowmeter and used time frequency analysis to extract flow rate in MATLAB.
