Aerobatic Black Box, Senior Design Project Aug 2024 – Present
- Developed an attitude and heading reference system to capture and replay an aerobatic flight.
- Ensured that fusion of GPS, barometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes accurately tracked plane movement.
- Integrated cameras to record dashboard and control inputs into sensor package.
Liquid Bipropellant Rocket Test Campaign, BU Rocket Propulsion Group Mar 2024 – Present
-  Deployed new flight and GSE software for 4 cold flows, 2 hot fire attempts, and 2 hot fires.
- Performed electrical and sensor checkouts with new inhouse GUI and firmware stack.
- Resolved 100 ms data loss issues observed after second hot-fire attempt.
Liquid Bipropellant Rocket Flight Computer, BU Rocket Propulsion Group Jun 2023 – Present
- Produced Board I/O schematic and layout in Altium, consolidating connections into D-subs.
- Placed and routed components including ADCs, STM32, voltage monitors, linear regulators, and oscillators.
- Debugged with J-link and logic analyzer leading to second revision.
- Wrote flight software for integrated vehicle tests and launch.
Horizontal Test Stand Test Campaign, BU Rocket Propulsion Group Nov 2022 – May 2023
- Built and ran data acquisition for magnetic pick-up flowmeter.
- Remotely triggered Raspberry pi to log data from LabJack.
- Used time frequency analysis to extract flow rate using MATLAB.
- Worked on 3 cold flows, 2 hot fires, and 2 hot fire attempts of a liquid bipropellant engine.
