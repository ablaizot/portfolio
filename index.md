### [AXI C2C DMA for CERN DAQ Board](https://ablaizot.github.io/portfolio/2025/01/09/DMA_Driver.html)
I implemented an AXI DMA with the goal of improving chip to chip communication between the Zynq SoC and two Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs on the Apollo ATCA
blades for use at the HL-LHC. This project involved firmware, kernel drivers, and software. More information on the Apollo blades can be found in this [TWEPP conference paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03702)

### Aerobatic Black Box, Senior Design Project
This Aerobatic Black Box project aims to provide pilots with a means to review their in-flight performance. Our group's device seeks to accomplish this task by integrating digital sensors, cameras, and machine vision to record and digitize flight data and cockpit interactions, eventually incorporating this data into a 3D simulation. This simulation will allow pilots to analyze their performance from both internal and external perspectives. Significant progress has been made this semester, including the development of functional prototypes, sensor integration, and the implementation of machine vision models for instrument detection.


### Icarus - Liquid Bipropellant Rocket, BURPFG
Icarus is a 17-ft long liquid bipropellant rocket using isopropyl alcohol and nitrous oxide slated to launch in March 2025. The engine, Iron Lotus IV, has a maximum thrust of 2,500 lbf (11 kN).
I designed and iterated on a PCB for the flight computer. I also wrote flight software for the sampling and logging of the onboard pressure transducers, thermocouples, accelerometers, and barometric altimeters.

### Horizontal Test Stand (HTS), BUPRG
HTS is mobile test stand capable of testing liquid bipropellant engines up to 10,000 lbf. After 3 cold flow operations, HTS fired the Iron Lotus IV engine 3 times in spring of 2023. I built and ran data acquisition for magnetic pick-up flowmeter and used time frequency analysis to extract flow rate in MATLAB.
